Settings
Stored File:
- Settings are stored to the disk through Electron-Store. The default store location varies depending on system. For windows users it is:
	C:\Users\*YOUR_USERNAME*\AppData\Roaming\electron-store-nodejs\Config\config.json

Google Cloud Vision:

As the identification provided by google is NOT free, you will need to provide your OWN google cloud vision project to bill the costs to.
A setup guide can be found here:

	- The score ranges from '0' (extremely uncertain) to '1' (extremely certain). Most identified scores are within the 0.4-0.7 range.
		- A '1' score is almost never reached, while a '0' score is usually ommitted by default. 
	- You can set these score filters. Note that manually set filters above '1' do not make a difference
- Safe Search Filter:
	- If the identified SafeSearch rating is above the filter you set, the image will be added to the results.
